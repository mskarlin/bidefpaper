abstract = {We use the Potts-lattice gas model to study nucleation at and near the eutectic composition. We use rare-event methods to compute the free energy landscape for the competing nucleation products, and short trajectories at the barrier top to obtain prefactors. We introduce a procedure to tune the frequency of semigrand Monte Carlo moves so that the dynamics of a small closed system roughly resemble those of an infinite system. The non-dimensionalized nucleation rates follow trends as predicted by the classical nucleation theory. Finally, we develop corrections that convert free energy surfaces from closed (canonical) simulations into free energy surfaces from open (semigrand) simulations. The new corrections extend earlier corrections to now address situations like nucleation at the eutectic point where two products nucleate competitively.},

@article{Argaman1998,
abstract = {Density Functional Theory (DFT) is one of the most widely used methods for "ab initio" calculations of the structure of atoms, molecules, crystals, surfaces, and their interactions. Unfortunately, the customary introduction to DFT is often considered too lengthy to be included in various curricula. An alternative introduction to DFT is presented here, drawing on ideas which are well-known from thermodynamics, especially the idea of switching between different independent variables. The central theme of DFT, i.e. the notion that it is possible and beneficial to replace the dependence on the external potential v(r) by a dependence on the density distribution n(r), is presented as a straightforward generalization of the familiar Legendre transform from the chemical potential ($\backslash$mu) to the number of particles (N). This approach is used here to introduce the Hohenberg-Kohn energy functional and to obtain the corresponding theorems, using classical nonuniform fluids as simple examples. The energy functional for electronic systems is considered next, and the Kohn-Sham equations are derived. The exchange-correlation part of this functional is discussed, including both the local density approximation to it, and its formally exact expression in terms of the exchange-correlation hole. A very brief survey of various applications and extensions is included.},

abstract = {We present a study of the structural stability of the lithium-orthophosphate oxide LiCoPO4 using density-functional theory within the local-density (LDA), generalized gradient and LDA+U approximation. We show that both enhanced localization and anisotropic effects provided within the LDA+U approximation are essential to reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic structure, lattice parameters, and stability of the lithiated and nonlithiated compound. Within this approximation, the intercalation voltage of 4.6 eV as well as the insulator character of the lithiated and nonlithiated compounds are recovered. Moreover, we found that the LDA+U approximation induces a strong transfer of charge from the t2g-like to the eg-like orbitals of Co as well as a significant shift of the LiPO4 band. Both effects are competing with each other and determine most of the peculiar properties of the LiCoPO4 and CoPO4 compounds.},

abstract = {We extend the program potfit, which generates effective atomic interaction potentials from ab initio data, to electrostatic interactions and induced dipoles. The potential parametrization algorithm uses the Wolf direct, pairwise summation method with spherical truncation. The polarizability of oxygen atoms is modeled with the Tangney-Scandolo interatomic force field approach. Due to the Wolf summation, the computational effort in simulation scales linearly in the number of particles, despite the presence of electrostatic interactions. Thus, this model allows to perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of metal oxides with realistic potentials. Details of the implementation are given, and the generation of potentials for SiO(2) and MgO is demonstrated. The approach is validated by simulations of microstructural, thermodynamic, and vibrational properties of liquid silica and magnesia.},

We present studies of both liquid and crystalline structures of silica (SiO(2)), magnesia (MgO) and alumina (Al(2)O(3)). For each of the three oxides, two separately optimized sets of force fields were used: (i) long-range Coulomb interactions between oxide and metal ions combined with a short-range pair potential; (ii) extension of force field (i) by adding polarizability to the oxygen ions. We show that while an effective potential of type (i) without polarizable oxygen ions can describe radial distributions and lattice constants reasonably well, potentials of type (ii) are required to obtain correct values for bond angles and the equation of state. The importance of polarizability for metal oxide properties decreases with increasing temperature.},

abstract = {We describe a new method for constructing empirical valence bond potential energy surfaces using a parallel multilevel genetic program (PMLGP). Genetic programs can be used to perform an efficient search through function space and parameter space to find the best functions and sets of parameters that fit energies obtained by ab initio electronic structure calculations. Building on the traditional genetic program approach, the PMLGP utilizes a hierarchy of genetic programming on two different levels. The lower level genetic programs are used to optimize coevolving populations in parallel while the higher level genetic program (HLGP) is used to optimize the genetic operator probabilities of the lower level genetic programs. The HLGP allows the algorithm to dynamically learn the mutation or combination of mutations that most effectively increase the fitness of the populations, causing a significant increase in the algorithm's accuracy and efficiency. The algorithm's accuracy and efficiency is tested against a standard parallel genetic program with a variety of one-dimensional test cases. Subsequently, the PMLGP is utilized to obtain an accurate empirical valence bond model for proton transfer in 3-hydroxy-gamma-pyrone in gas phase and protic solvent.},

@article{Bockris1963,
abstract = {Former models of the electric double layer, and several alternative possibilities, lack consistency with six well-known facts. The paper attempts to adduce models which allow interpretation of these. The potential, not the charge, is the dependent variable in the double layer. The distortion dielectric constant of the water adsorbed on an electrode is six, not n\$\^{}2\_\backslash infty\$. The constant minimum capacity on the negative branch is interpreted in terms of a model in which Gouy adsorption begins outside the first layer of water molecules. Super-equivalent adsorption is purely electrostatic in nature and becomes appreciable if the ionic radius is > 1.4 \$\backslash overset\{\backslash circ\}\{\backslash mathrm A\}\$. The isotherm for this type of adsorption is treated in terms of lateral repulsion. The model is shown to give rise to a correct dependence of amount adsorbed on charge. The `capacitance hump' arises from the slowing down of the rate of increase of the charge on the anions in the Helmholtz layer with increasingly positive charge on the metal due to repulsion among the anions. Some properties of the oriented dipole layer on electrodes are treated. The capacitance contributions due to change in the potential contribution of such dipoles to the Galvani p.d. with change in electrode charge is negligible. There is no unique value of \$\backslash chi\_\{dipole\}\$, for this is potential dependent. The maximum value, calculated for extreme values of charge on the electrode, is < 100 mV. The adsorption of aliphatic substances in terms of numerous models is discussed. Some newly available facts are inconsistent with theories previously discussed. They are consistent with a `competition with water' model in which the essential feature is the turning over of water molecules on the negative side of the e.c.m.},

The application of the extended functional to archetypal Mott-charge-transfer (NiO) and covalently bonded insulators (Si and GaAs) demonstrates its accuracy and versatility and the possibility to obtain a unifying and equally accurate description for a broad range of very diverse systems.},

It is an attempt to introduce density-functional theory (DFT) in a language accessible for students entering the field or researchers from other fields. It is not meant to be a scholarly review of DFT, but rather an informal guide to its conceptual basis and some recent developments and advances. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorem and the Kohn-Sham equations are discussed in some detail. Approximate density functionals, selected aspects of applications of DFT, and a variety of extensions of standard DFT are also discussed, albeit in less detail. Throughout it is attempted to provide a balanced treatment of aspects that are relevant for chemistry and aspects relevant for physics, but with a strong bias towards conceptual foundations. The paper is intended to be read before (or in parallel with) one of the many excellent more technical reviews available in the literature.},

Comparison of calculation predictions with experimental data show good agreement.

In this paper, we reported formation of a series of BMG matrix composites which contain a high Al content up to 55 at.\%. These composites can be cast at extraordinarily low cooling rates, compatible with maximum rod diameters of over a centimetre in copper mold casting. Our results indicate that proper additions of transition element Fe which have a positive heat of mixing with the main constituents La and Ce can appreciably improve the formability of the BMG matrix composites by suppressing the precipitation of Al(La,Ce) phase resulted from occurrence of the phase separation. However, the optimum content of Fe addition is strongly dependant on the total amount of the Al content in the Al-(CoCu)-(La,Ce) alloys.},

@article{Cheng2012b,
abstract = {The position of electronic energy levels in a phase depends on the surface potentials at its boundaries. Bringing two phases in contact at an interface will alter the surface potentials shifting the energy levels relative to each other. Calculating such shifts for electrochemical interfaces requires a combination of methods from computational surface science and physical chemistry. The problem is closely related to the computation of potentials of electrochemically inactive electrodes. These so-called ideally polarizable interfaces are impossible to cross for electrons. In this perspective we review two density functional theory based methods that have been developed for this purpose, the workfunction method and the hydrogen insertion method. The key expressions of the two methods are derived from the formal theory of absolute electrode potentials. As an illustration of the workfunction method we review the computation of the potential of zero charge of the Pt(111)-water interface as recently published by a number of groups. The example of the hydrogen insertion method is from our own work on the rutile TiO(2)(110)-water interface at the point of zero proton charge. The calculations are summarized in level diagrams aligning the electronic energy levels of the solid electrode (Fermi level of the metal, valence band maximum and conduction band minimum of the semiconductor) to the band edges of liquid water and the standard potential for the reduction of the hydroxyl radical. All potentials are calculated at the same level of density functional theory using the standard hydrogen electrode as common energy reference. Comparison to experiment identifies the treatment of the valence band of water as a potentially dangerous source of error for application to electrocatalysis and photocatalysis.},

abstract = {An interatomic potential for Al is developed within the third generation of the charge optimized many-body (COMB3) formalism. The database used for the parameterization of the potential consists of experimental data and the results of first-principles and quantum chemical calculations. The potential exhibits reasonable agreement with cohesive energy, lattice parameters, elastic constants, bulk and shear modulus, surface energies, stacking fault energies, point defect formation energies, and the phase order of metallic Al from experiments and density functional theory. In addition, the predicted phonon dispersion is in good agreement with the experimental data and first-principles calculations. Importantly for the prediction of the mechanical behavior, the unstable stacking fault energetics along the [Formula: see text] direction on the (1 1 1) plane are similar to those obtained from first-principles calculations. The polycrsytal when strained shows responses that are physical and the overall behavior is consistent with experimental observations.},

abstract = {Electronic structure calculations were performed to study the role of misfit dislocations on the structure and chemistry of a metal/oxide interface. We found that a chemical imbalance exists at the misfit dislocation which leads to dramatic changes in the point defect content at the interface - stabilizing the structure requires removing as much as 50\% of the metal atoms and insertion of a large number of oxygen interstitials. The exact defect composition that stabilizes the interface is sensitive to the external oxygen partial pressure. We relate the preferred defect structure at the interface to a competition between chemical and strain energies as defects are introduced.},

abstract = {Nucleation from solution is important in many pharmaceutical crystallization, biomineralization, material synthesis, and self-assembly processes. Simulation methodology has progressed rapidly for studies of nucleation in pure component and implicit solvent systems; however little progress has been made in the simulation of explicit solvent systems. The impasse stems from the inability of rare events simulation methodology to be combined with simulation techniques which maintain a constant chemical potential driving force (supersaturation) for nucleation. We present a Potts lattice gas (PLG) to aid in the development of new simulation strategies for nucleation from solution. The PLG captures common crystallization phase diagram features such as a eutectic point and solute/solvent melting points. Simulations of the PLG below the bulk solute melting temperature reveal a competition between amorphous and crystalline nuclei. As the temperature is increased toward the bulk melting temperature, the nucleation pathway changes from a one step crystalline nucleation pathway to a two step pathway, where an amorphous nucleus forms and then crystallizes. We explain these results in terms of classical nucleation theory with different size-dependant chemical potentials for the amorphous and crystalline nucleation pathways. The two step pathway may be particularly important when crystallization is favored only at postcritical sizes.},

This reformulation allows a natural extension of the method to potentials of the form 1/r p withp>1. Furthermore, efficient calculation of the virial tensor follows. Use ofB-splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as Nlog(N). For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 \AA or less. © 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

This ground state may be difficult to access in practice and it has in fact so far escaped a proper identification. The introduction of a Hubbard-U term in the energy functional stabilizes the physical ground state and makes it easily accessible to routine calculations. When this contribution is defined in terms of maximally localized Wannier functions, the calculated energies and structural properties are independent of the value of the parameter U.},

One of these, the damped shifted force method, shows a remarkable ability to reproduce the energetic and dynamic characteristics exhibited by simulations employing lattice summation techniques. Comparisons were performed with this and other pairwise methods against the smooth particle-mesh Ewald summation to see how well they reproduce the energetics and dynamics of a variety of molecular simulations.},

abstract = {Modern methods of quantum mechanics have proved to be effective tools to understand and even predict materials properties. An essential element of the materials design process, relevant to both new materials and the optimization of existing ones, is knowing which crystal structures will form in an alloy system. Crystal structure can only be predicted effectively with quantum mechanics if an algorithm to direct the search through the large space of possible structures is found. We present a new approach to the prediction of structure that rigorously mines correlations embodied within experimental data and uses them to direct quantum mechanical techniques efficiently towards the stable crystal structure of materials.},

A proper selection of metal/oxide interface, film thickness, lattice mismatch, etc. makes it possible to prepare collections of supported metal particles with novel properties. This critical review describes some illustrative examples, emphasizes the role of the interplay between theory and experiment, and relates some recent findings related to the possibility to control the charge state of a supported nanoparticle on an ultrathin oxide film (211 references).},

abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

@article{Giannozzi2004,
abstract = {The composition and structure of the semiarid or desert grasslands of southwestern North America have changed over the past 150 y. Brushy or woody species in these communities have increased in density and cover. This increase in density of woody species is called brush encroachment because most of these species have been present in these communities at lower densities for thousands of years. The brushy or woody species were not introduced from other continents or from great distances. They are indigenous species that have increased in density or cover because of changes in local abiotic or biotic conditions. The brushy and woody plants are not the cause of these changes, but their increase is the result of other factors. The causes of changes that have led to the present woody-brushy composition of these semiarid grasslands has been difficult to determine. Warming of the climate seems to be a background condition, but the driving force seems to be chronic, high levels of herbivory by domestic animals. This herbivory has reduced the aboveground grass biomass, leading to the reduction of fine fuel and a concomitant reduction or complete elimination of grassland fires. This combination of factors favors the encroachment, establishment, survival and growth of woody plants. Less competition from grasses, dispersal of seeds of woody plants by domestic animals, and changes in rodent, lagomorph, and insect populations seem to modify the rate of change. Elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 are not necessary to explain shrub encroachment in these semiarid grasslands. The direction of future change is difficult to predict. The density of brushy and woody plants will probably increase as will the stature and number of species. However, if soil nutrients increase, woody legumes may be replaced by other brushy or woody species. Reversing the changes that have been going on for 150 y will be a difficult, long-term, and perhaps impossible, task},

abstract = {In this paper, the dynamical properties of the electrochemical double layer following an electron transfer are investigated by using Brownian dynamics simulations. This work is motivated by recent developments in ultrafast cyclic voltammetry which allow nanosecond time scales to be reached. A simple model of an electrochemical cell is developed by considering a 1:1 supporting electrolyte between two parallel walls carrying opposite surface charges, representing the electrodes; the solution also contains two neutral solutes representing the electroactive species. Equilibrium Brownian dynamics simulations of this system are performed. To mimic electron transfer processes at the electrode, the charge of the electroactive species are suddenly changed, and the subsequent relaxation of the surrounding ionic atmosphere are followed, using nonequilibrium Brownian dynamics. The electrostatic potential created in the center of the electroactive species by other ions is found to have an exponential decay which allows the evaluation of a characteristic relaxation time. The influence of the surface charge and of the electrolyte concentration on this time is discussed, for several conditions that mirror the ones of classical electrochemical experiments. The computed relaxation time of the double layer in aqueous solutions is found in the range 0.1 to 0.4 ns for electrolyte concentrations between 0.1 and 1 mol L(-1) and surface charges between 0.032 and 0.128 C m(-2).},

abstract = {In order to get a better control over the anodization process of aluminium, it is necessary to obtain a better understanding of the process at an atomic scale. In order to achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to study the reactions taking place during the initial formation of an anodic oxide layer, and to determine the influence of the electric field strength, temperature and environment on these reactions and the ion movement in the oxide layer. Simulations are performed regarding the oxidation of aluminium in an atomic oxygen environment under the influence of an external electric field, regarding the anodization of aluminium in water, in an oxalic acid solution and in an ammonium tartrate solution. It was found that applying a higher electric field strength only significantly influences the oxide thickness if this electric field strength is higher than a certain critical value. A higher temperature lowers this critical value. In an ammonium tartrate solution the tartrate ions assist in the formation of an oxide layer, leading to a thicker layer at a lower field strength as compared with anodization in pure water. To improve the modelling of the anodization process the charge equilibration procedure should be adjusted for a more realistic description of the charges and, with that, a more realistic description of the reactions that take place during the anodization process.},

abstract = {In pondering of new promising transparent conductors to replace the cost rising tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), metal nanowires have been widely concerned. Herein, we demonstrate an approach for successful synthesis of long and fine Cu nanowires (NWs) through a novel catalytic scheme involving nickel ions. Such Cu NWs in high aspect ratio (diameter of 16.2 ± 2 nm and length up to 40 $\mu$m) provide long distance for electron transport and, meanwhile, large space for light transmission. Transparent electrodes fabricated using the Cu NW ink achieve a low sheet resistance of 1.4 Ohm/sq at 14\% transmittance and a high transparency of 93.1\% at 51.5 Ohm/sq. The flexibility and stability were tested with 100-timebending by 180°and no resistance change occurred. Ohmic contact was achieved to the p- and n-GaN on blue light emitting diode chip and bright electroluminescence from the front face confirmed the excellent transparency.},

abstract = {Control of the material microstructure in terms of the grain size is a key component in tailoring material properties of metals and alloys and in creating functionally graded materials. To exert this control, reliable and efficient modeling and simulation of the recrystallization process whereby the grain size evolves is vital. The present contribution is a review paper, summarizing the current status of various approaches to modeling grain refinement due to recrystallization. The underlying mechanisms of recrystallization are briefly recollected and different simulation methods are discussed. Analytical and empirical models, continuum mechanical models and discrete methods as well as phase field, vertex and level set models of recrystallization will be considered. Such numerical methods have been reviewed previously, but with the present focus on recrystallization modeling and with a rapidly increasing amount of related publications, an updated review is called for. Advantages and disadvantages of the different methods are discussed in terms of applicability, underlying assumptions, physical relevance, implementation issues and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {The history of tight-binding theory is traced, from the corresponding band models of Bloch, to the development of universal parameters, derivable from a combination of tight-binding theory and free-electron theory. In the end, tight-binding theory becomes an independent, and in that sense ab initio, method for studying virtually all of the properties of surfaces. It is this conceptual aspect, rather than semiempirical tight-binding theory as an approximate computational method, which is emphasized here. We outline the application first to surface energy, and its dependence upon structure, for semiconductors, ionic insulators, and simple metals, finding wide differences from the rudimentary view of one bond energy per broken bond. We turn to photothresholds. work functions and electron affinities, finding direct tight-binding predictions but necessary corrections for image potentials, which also are derivable in terms of tight-binding theory. For the particular case of electron affinities there are additional corrections to the band gap, usually associated with correlation energy, but readily and generally estimated as the intra-atomic Coulomb U divided by the dielectric constant. We turn to history of the understanding of heterojunction band line-ups, which in the end can be obtained by matching neutrality levels in each band structure, those levels being the average sp3-hybrid energy in tight-binding theory and in the case of metals, the Fermi energy. Alternate views are also discussed as is the bonding of individual atoms to the surface. Finally, the successes and failures of tight-binding theory in understanding semiconductor surface reconstructions are reviewed.},

The results of calculations for the M—X− and M12—X− (M = Cu, Ag, Au; X = F, Cl, Br, I) systems are presented. At the (100) surface, modeled in the present work by the M12 cluster, all halide ions have been found to adsorb preferentially at the hollow site, followed by the bridge and by the top positions. The adsorption energy has been found to decrease when going from fluoride to iodide in both atom—ion and cluster—ion cases. The opposite trend is observed for the estimates of the charge transfer from the ions to the surface. When different metals are compared, the M12—X− interaction energies decrease in the order Au \&gt; Ag \&gt; Cu, but for the smaller ions some deviations from this line do appear. The relative values of the calculated harmonic vibrational frequencies do agree with those found experimentally, but their magnitude is much smaller as a result of the effect of the lower surface coverage.},

To rectify this, we introduce a new, basis-set independent, matrix-based formulation of generalized density functional theories which reduces the development, implementation, and dissemination of new techniques to the derivation and transcription of a few lines of algebra. This new framework enables us to concisely demystify the inner workings of fully functional, highly efficient modern ab initio codes and to give complete instructions for their construction for calculations employing arbitrary basis sets. Within this framework, we also discuss in full detail a variety of leading-edge techniques, minimization algorithms, and highly efficient computational kernels for use with scalar as well as shared and distributed-memory supercomputer architectures.},

@article{Jain2011a,
abstract = {Standard approximations to the density functional theory exchange-correlation functional have been extraordinary successful, but calculating formation enthalpies of reactions involving compounds with both localized and delocalized electronic states remains challenging. In this work we examine the shortcomings of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and GGA+U in accurately characterizing such difficult reactions. We then outline a methodology that mixes GGA and GGA+U total energies (using known binary formation data for calibration) to more accurately predict formation enthalpies. We demonstrate that for a test set of 49 ternary oxides, our methodology can reduce the mean absolute relative error in calculated formation enthalpies from approximately 7.7–21\% in GGA+U to under 2\%. As another example we show that neither GGA nor GGA+U alone accurately reproduces the Fe-P-O phase diagram; however, our mixed methodology successfully predicts all known phases as stable by naturally stitching together GGA and GGA+U results. As a final example we demonstrate how our technique can be applied to the calculation of the Li-conversion voltage of LiFeF3. Our results indicate that mixing energies of several functionals represents one avenue to improve the accuracy of total energy computations without affecting the cost of calculation.},

@article{Jang2012,
abstract = {Nanotwinned metals are attractive in many applications because they simultaneously demonstrate high strength and high ductility, characteristics that are usually thought to be mutually exclusive. However, most nanotwinned metals are produced in polycrystalline forms and therefore contain randomly oriented twin and grain boundaries making it difficult to determine the origins of their useful mechanical properties. Here, we report the fabrication of arrays of vertically aligned copper nanopillars that contain a very high density of periodic twin boundaries and no grain boundaries or other microstructural features. We use tension experiments, transmission electron microscopy and atomistic simulations to investigate the influence of diameter, twin-boundary spacing and twin-boundary orientation on the mechanical responses of individual nanopillars. We observe a brittle-to-ductile transition in samples with orthogonally oriented twin boundaries as the twin-boundary spacing decreases below a critical value (∼3-4 nm for copper). We also find that nanopillars with slanted twin boundaries deform via shear offsets and significant detwinning. The ability to decouple nanotwins from other microstructural features should lead to an improved understanding of the mechanical properties of nanotwinned metals.},

abstract = {First principles density-functional slab calculations are used to study 5 angstroms (two O-layer) Al2O3 films on Ru(0001) and Al(111). Using larger unit cells than in a recent study, it is found that the lowest energy stable film has an even mix of tetrahedral (t) and octahedral (o) site Al ions, and thus most closely resembles the ??-phase of bulk alumina. Here, alternating zig-zag rows of t and o occur within the surface plane, resulting in a greater average lateral separation of the Al-ions than with pure t or o. A second structure with an even mix of t and o has also been found, consisting of alternating stripes. These patterns mix easily, can exist in three equivalent directions on basal substrates, and can also be displaced laterally, suggesting a mechanism for a loss of long-range order in the Al-sublattice. While the latter would cause the film to appear amorphous in diffraction experiments, local coordination and film density are little affected. On a film supported by rigid Ru(0001), overlayers of Cu, Pd, and Pt bind similarly as on bulk truncated ??-Al2O3(0001). However, when the film is supported by soft Al(111), the adhesion of Cu, Pd, and Pt metal overlayers is significantly increased: oxide-surface Al atoms rise so only they contact the overlayer, while substrate Al metal atoms migrate into the oxide film. Thus the binding energy of metal overlayers is strongly substrate dependent, and our numbers for the above Pd-overlayer systems bracket a recent experimentally derived value for a film on NiAl(110).},

abstract = {Corrosion is a fundamental problem in electrochemistry and represents a mode of failure of technologically important materials. Understanding the basic mechanism of aqueous corrosion of metals such as Cu in presence of halide ions is hence essential. Using molecular dynamics simulations incorporating reactive force-field (ReaxFF), the interaction of copper substrates and chlorine under aqueous conditions has been investigated. These simulations incorporate effects of proton transfer in the aqueous media and are suitable for modeling the bond formation and bond breakage phenomenon that is associated with complex aqueous corrosion phenomena. Systematic investigation of the corrosion process has been carried out by simulating different chlorine concentration and solution states. The structural and morphological differences associated with metal dissolution in the presence of chloride ions are evaluated using dynamical correlation functions. The simulated atomic trajectories are used to analyze the charged states, molecular structure and ion density distribution which are utilized to understand the atomic scale mechanism of corrosion of copper substrates under aqueous conditions. Increased concentration of chlorine and higher ambient temperature were found to expedite the corrosion of copper. In order to study the effect of solution states on the corrosion resistance of Cu, partial fractions of proton or hydroxide in water were configured, and higher corrosion rate at partial fraction hydroxide environment was observed. When the Cl(-) concentration is low, oxygen or hydroxide ion adsorption onto Cu surface has been confirmed in partial fraction hydroxide environment. Our study provides new atomic scale insights into the early stages of aqueous corrosion of metals such as copper.},

Recently we suggested how to calculate U from first-principles, using a method which we named constrained RPA (cRPA). The input is simply the Kohn-Sham eigenfunctions and eigenvalues obtained within the LDA. In our proposed self-consistent LDA+U scheme, we calculate the LDA+U eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and use these to extract U. The updated U is then used in the next iteration to obtain a new set of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues and the iteration is continued until convergence is achieved. The most significant result is that our numerical approach is indeed stable: it is possible to find the effective exchange and correlation interaction matrix in a self-consistent way, resulting in a significant improvement over the LDA results, regarding both the bandgap in NiO and the f-band exchange spin-splitting in Gd, but some discrepancies still remain.},

This is of particular importance in both the understanding of natural aquatic environment processes and efficient industrial applications. The chemistry of alumina reactions in water is complex. The adsorption ability of alumina towards organic and inorganic compounds might be influenced by several factors such as: surface characteristics of the adsorbent (surface area, density, pore volume, porosity, pore size distribution, pH(PZC) as well as mechanical strength and purity), pH of the solution, ionic strength, composition of water and the physicochemical properties of adsorbates. The aim of this paper is to give a brief review of the properties of alumina and its reactivity with organic and inorganic compounds present in aqueous solutions.

abstract = {A computationally efficient method was developed for calculating Coulomb interactions in three-dimensional (3D) systems with two-dimensional (2D) periodicity; the 2D particle-mesh Ewald (2D-PME) method we previously developed was extended. The formulation and numerical algorithms are described in detail for calculating the Coulomb potential energy, the Coulomb force, and the Coulomb component of the pressure tensor. Computational efficiency and accuracy of the 2D-PME method were evaluated for two water systems with 2D periodicity in the x and y directions and with non-periodicity in the z direction. Compared with exact results calculated by using the original 2D Ewald summations, the 2D-PME method yielded significantly accurate calculations, similar to the computationally efficient method we previously developed for calculating 2D Ewald summations (2D-EW method). For a given accuracy, the 2D-PME method was faster than the 2D-EW method for the water systems we examined. The computational effort of the 2D-PME method decreases as the computationally efficiency of the Fourier transforms used in the 2D-PME method increases. The 2D-PME method is therefore promising for accelerating molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations for 3D systems with 2D periodicity. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The surface of water provides an excellent environment for gliding movement, in both nature and modern technology, from surface living animals such as the water strider, to Langmuir-Blodgett films. The high surface tension of water keeps the contacting objects afloat, and its low viscosity enables almost frictionless sliding on the surface. Here we utilize the water surface as a nearly ideal underlying support for free-standing ultra-thin films and develop a novel tensile testing method for the precise measurement of mechanical properties of the films. In this method, namely, the pseudo free-standing tensile test, all specimen preparation and testing procedures are performed on the water surface, resulting in easy handling and almost frictionless sliding without specimen damage or substrate effects. We further utilize van der Waals adhesion for the damage-free gripping of an ultra-thin film specimen. Our approach can potentially be used to explore the mechanical properties of emerging two-dimensional materials.},

The electrocatalytic activity of these nanowires toward the oxygen reduction reaction was studied in relation to the activity of both supported and unsupported Pt nanoparticles as well as with previously synthesized Pt nanotubes. Our ultrathin, acid-treated, unsupported nanowires displayed an electrochemical surface area activity of 1.45 mA/cm(2), which was nearly 4 times greater than that of analogous, unsupported platinum nanotubes and 7 times greater than that of commercial supported platinum nanoparticles.},

The effects that size and strain rate have on the stretching behaviour of these nanowires are investigated through the simulation of nanowires with three characteristic sizes of 2, 4 and 6 nm, subjected to three distinct strain rates of 4.0 x 10(8), 4.0 x 10(9) and 4.0 x 10(10) s(-1). The selected strain rates produce three distinct modes of deformation, namely crystalline-ordered deformation, mixed-mode deformation and amorphous-disordered deformation, respectively. The mechanisms behind the observations of these distinct deformation modes are analysed and explained. A Doppler 'red-shift' effect is observed when the nanowires are strained at the highest strain rate of 4.0 x 10(10) s(-1). This effect is most pronounced for the nanowire subjected to the largest stretch velocity. As a result, a constrained dynamic free-vibration phenomenon is observed during stretching, which eventually leads to delocalized multiple necking, instead of a single localized neck when it is strained at a lower rate. This unique phenomenon is discussed and future research effort is in the pipeline for a more detailed investigation into metallic nanowires strained at a supersonic velocity.},

abstract = {One of the most important tasks of modern, physical electrochemistry is the development of an atomistic picture of the solid/liquid interface in order to provide the basis for a mechanistic understanding of electrochemical processes. Electrochemists seek answers to the same questions as their surface science colleagues (e.g., electronic and structure properties of surfaces and adlayers), but are faced with the fact that in electrochemistry the contact of the solid with a condensed phase, the electrolyte, makes life much more difficult. Nevertheless, electrochemists succeeded in the last 20 years to develop an electrochemical surface science by adopting experimental techniques and theoretical concepts from surface physicists. This article describes the various routes electrochemists have used to obtain a detailed characterization of electrode surfaces in particular, and of the electrochemical interface in general. Success in physical electrochemistry is based on the development of non-traditional in situ methods to complement the classical, current- and voltage-based techniques. The former range from optical spectroscopies, linear and non-linear, to in situ X-ray diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy. The current status of electrochemical surface science and its most important future goals are briefly addressed. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kovalenko1999,
abstract = {We have developed a self-consistent description of an interface between a metal and a molecular liquid by combination of the density functional theory in the Kohn–Sham formulation ͑KS DFT͒ for the electronic structure, and the three-dimensional generalization of the reference interaction site model ͑3D RISM͒ for the classical site distribution profiles of liquid. The electron and classical subsystems are coupled in the mean field approximation. The procedure takes account of many-body effects of dense fluid on the metal–liquid interactions by averaging the pseudopotentials of liquid molecules over the classical distributions of the liquid. The proposed approach is substantially less time-consuming as compared to a Car–Parrinello-type simulation since it replaces molecular dynamics with the integral equation theory of molecular liquids. The calculation has been performed for pure water at normal conditions in contact with the ͑100͒ face cubic centered ͑fcc͒ surface of a metal roughly modeled after copper. The results are in good agreement with the Car–Parrinello simulation for the same metal model. The shift of the Fermi level due to the presence of water conforms with experiment. The electron distribution near an adsorbed water molecule is affected by dense water, and so the metal–water attraction follows the shapes of the metal effective electrostatic potential. For the metal model employed, it is strongest at the hollow site adsorption positions, and water molecules are adsorbed mainly at the hollow and bridge site positions rather than over metal atoms. Layering of water molecules near the metal surface is found. In the first hydration layer, adsorbed water molecules are oriented in parallel to the surface or tilted with hydrogens mainly outwards the metal. This orientation at the potential of zero charge agrees with experiment. © 1999 American Institute of Physics. ͓S0021-9606͑99͒51420-7͔},

abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay’s DIIS method (direct inversion in the iterative subspace) to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay’s scheme. A special ‘‘metric’’ and a special ‘‘preconditioning’’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms. We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP (Vienna ab initio simulation package). The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems (liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors) and turned out to be very reliable. © 1996 The American Physical Society.},

Notwithstanding this central importance, density-functional theory calculations based on generalized-gradient approximations often fail to describe energetics, multiplet structures, reaction barriers, and geometries around the active sites. We suggest here an alternative approach, derived from the Hubbard U correction to solid-state problems, that provides an excellent agreement with correlated-electron quantum chemistry calculations in test cases that range from the ground state of Fe2 and Fe2- to the addition elimination of molecular hydrogen on FeO+. The Hubbard U is determined with a novel self-consistent procedure based on a linear-response approach.},

abstract = {We introduce an improvement to the Hubbard U augmented density functional approach known as DFT+U that incorporates variations in the value of self-consistently calculated, linear-response U with changes in geometry. This approach overcomes the one major shortcoming of previous DFT+U studies, i.e., the use of an averaged Hubbard U when comparing energies for different points along a potential energy surface is no longer required. While DFT+U is quite successful at providing accurate descriptions of localized electrons (e.g., d or f) by correcting self-interaction errors of standard exchange correlation functionals, we show several diatomic molecule examples where this position-dependent DFT+U(R) provides a significant two- to four-fold improvement over DFT+U predictions, when compared to accurate correlated quantum chemistry and experimental references. DFT+U(R) reduces errors in binding energies, frequencies, and equilibrium bond lengths by applying the linear-response, position-dependent U(R) at each configuration considered. This extension is most relevant where variations in U are large across the points being compared, as is the case with covalent diatomic molecules such as transition-metal oxides. We thus provide a tool for deciding whether a standard DFT+U approach is sufficient by determining the strength of the dependence of U on changes in coordinates. We also apply this approach to larger systems with greater degrees of freedom and demonstrate how DFT+U(R) may be applied automatically in relaxations, transition-state finding methods, and dynamics.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the addition-elimination reaction pathways for the gas-phase conversion of molecular hydrogen and methane on FeO(+) to water and methanol, respectively, using first-principles calculations. These two reactions represent paradigmatic, challenging test cases for electronic structure approaches to transition-metal catalysis. We compare here density-functional approaches against state-of-the-art coupled-cluster and multireference quantum chemistry approaches. The quantum chemical approaches are found to be in close agreement between themselves as well as with the available experimental evidence. For the density-functional calculations, we employ a recently introduced ab initio, self-consistent Hubbard-like correction, coupled here with a generalized-gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional. We find that our formulation provides a remarkable improvement in the description of the electronic structure, hybridization, and multiplet splittings for all calculated stationary points along these reaction pathways. The Hubbard term, which is not a fitting parameter and, in principle, can augment any exchange-correlation functional, brings the density-functional theory results in close agreement with the reference calculations. In particular, thermochemical errors as large as 1.4 eV in the exit channels with the GGA functional are reduced by an order of magnitude, to less than 0.1 eV on average; additionally, close agreement with the correlated-electron reference calculations and experiments are achieved for intermediate spin splittings and structures, reaction exothermicity, and spin crossovers. The role that the Hubbard U term plays in improving both quantitative and qualitative descriptions of transition-metal chemistry is examined, and its strengths as well as possible weaknesses are discussed in detail.},

Unlike previous comparisons between c-DFT and Monte Carlo (MC), the present 3CM incorporates Lennard-Jones interactions rather than hard-sphere and hard-wall repulsions. c-DFT and MD results are compared over normalized surface charges ranging from 0.2 to 1.75 and bulk ion concentrations from 10 mM to 1 M. Agreement between the two, assessed by electric surface potential and ion density profiles, is found to be quite good. Wall potentials predicted by PB begin to depart significantly from c-DFT and MD for charge densities exceeding 0.3. Successive layers are observed to charge in a sequential manner such that the solvent becomes fully excluded from each layer before the onset of the next layer. Ultimately, this layer filling phenomenon results in fluid structures, Debye lengths, and electric surface potentials vastly different from the classical PB predictions.},

abstract = {Copper (Cu) thin films have been widely used as electrodes and interconnection wires in integrated electronic circuits, and more recently as substrates for the synthesis of graphene. However, the ultra-high vacuum processes required for high-quality Cu film fabrication, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), restricts mass production with low cost. In this work, we demonstrated high-quality Cu thin films using a single-crystal Cu target and radio-frequency (RF) sputtering technique; the resulting film quality was comparable to that produced using MBE, even under unfavorable conditions for pure Cu film growth. The Cu thin film was epitaxially grown on an Al2O3 (sapphire) (0001) substrate, and had high crystalline orientation along the (111) direction. Despite the 10(-3) Pa vacuum conditions, the resulting thin film was oxygen free due to the high chemical stability of the sputtered specimen from a single-crystal target; moreover, the deposited film had >5× higher adhesion force than that produced using a polycrystalline target. This fabrication method enabled Cu films to be obtained using a simple, manufacturing-friendly process on a large-area substrate, making our findings relevant for industrial applications.},

We then introduce a simple, computationally efficient approximate functional which we find to be quite successful in capturing a priori basic electrochemical phenomena, including the capacitive Stern and diffusive Gouy-Chapman regions in the electrochemical double layer, quantitative values for interfacial capacitance, and electrochemical potentials of zero charge for a series of metals. We explore surface charging with applied potential and are able to place our ab initio results directly on the scale associated with the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). Finally, we provide explicit details for implementation within standard density-functional theory software packages at negligible computational cost over standard calculations carried out within vacuum environments.},

For example, nanoelectromechanical resonators are very attractive for chip-based sensor arrays because of their potential for ultrasensitive mass detection. In this letter, we introduce a new bottom-up assembly method to fabricate large-area nanoelectromechanical arrays each having over 2,000 single-nanowire resonators. The nanowires are synthesized and chemically functionalized before they are integrated onto a silicon chip at predetermined locations. Peptide nucleic acid probe molecules attached to the nanowires before assembly maintain their binding selectivity and recognize complementary oligonucleotide targets once the resonator array is assembled. The two types of cantilevered resonators we integrated here using silicon and rhodium nanowires had Q-factors of approximately 4,500 and approximately 1,150, respectively, in vacuum. Taken together, these results show that bottom-up nanowire assembly can offer a practical alternative to top-down fabrication for sensitive chip-based detection.},

abstract = {Aluminum has long attracted attention as a potential battery anode because of its high theoretical voltage and specific energy. The protective oxide layer on the aluminum surface is however detrimental to the battery performance, contributing to failure to achieve the reversible potential and causing the delayed activation of the anode. By developing aluminum alloys as anodes and solution additives to electrolytes, a variety of aluminum batteries have been extensively investigated for various applications. From molten salt and other non-aqueous electrolytes, aluminum can be electrodeposited and therefore be suitable for developing rechargable batteries. Considerable efforts have been made to develop secondary aluminum batteries of high power density. In the present paper, these research activities are reviewed, including aqueous electrolyte primary batteries, aluminum-air batteries and molten salt secondary batteries. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Exploration of electrochemical properties in ultrasmall volumes is still an emerging area. It is not only of great importance for the fundamental research, but also endowed with practical significance in the area of bioanalysis and medicine. Microelectrodes with superior electrochemical characteristics and versatile configurations are suitable tools for the investigation in confined geometries, and remarkable progress involving both preparation methods and theoretical interpretation has been made during the last few decades. Despite this success, electrochemical studies in nanoscopic volumes are still highly challenging due to the less predictable situations in very limited spatial and temporal domains, as well as difficulty in micromanipulation at the nanoscale. In this mini-review, we will summarize the main strategies for this topic, briefly look through the recent advances, and specifically introduce the design and application of a new kind of on-chip ultrasmall electrochemical cells based on micro- and nanogap electrodes, which are prepared by photolithographic method with volume ranging from femtolitre to attolitre. Finally, the limits of current systems and the future perspectives of this field are discussed.},

abstract = {The present study sheds light on the long-standing challenges associated with high-voltage operation of LiNi(x)Mn(x)Co(1-2x)O2 cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Using correlated ensemble-averaged high-throughput X-ray absorption spectroscopy and spatially resolved electron microscopy and spectroscopy, here we report structural reconstruction (formation of a surface reduced layer, to transition) and chemical evolution (formation of a surface reaction layer) at the surface of LiNi(x)Mn(x)Co(1-2x)O2 particles. These are primarily responsible for the prevailing capacity fading and impedance buildup under high-voltage cycling conditions, as well as the first-cycle coulombic inefficiency. It was found that the surface reconstruction exhibits a strong anisotropic characteristic, which predominantly occurs along lithium diffusion channels. Furthermore, the surface reaction layer is composed of lithium fluoride embedded in a complex organic matrix. This work sets a refined example for the study of surface reconstruction and chemical evolution in battery materials using combined diagnostic tools at complementary length scales.},

abstract = {The performance of battery materials is largely governed by structural and chemical evolutions during electrochemical reactions. Therefore, resolving spatially dependent reaction pathways could enlighten mechanistic understanding, and enable rational design for rechargeable battery materials. Here, we present a phase evolution panorama via spectroscopic and three-dimensional imaging at multiple states of charge for an anode material (that is, nickel oxide nanosheets) in lithium-ion batteries. We reconstruct the three-dimensional lithiation/delithiation fronts and find that, in a fully electrolyte immersion environment, phase conversion can nucleate from spatially distant locations on the same slab of material. In addition, the architecture of a lithiated nickel oxide is a bent porous metallic framework. Furthermore, anode-electrolyte interphase is found to be dynamically evolving upon charging and discharging. The present study has implications for resolving the inhomogeneity of the general electrochemically driven phase transition (for example, intercalation reactions) and for the origin of inhomogeneous charge distribution in large-format battery electrodes.},

The functional contains an exact expression of the entropy of noninteracting molecules and thus provides an ideal starting point for the inclusion of complex intermolecular interactions which depend on the orientation of the interacting molecules. We show how an excess free-energy functional can be constructed to reproduce the following properties of water: the dielectric response; the experimental site-site correlation functions; the surface tension; the bulk modulus of the liquid and the variation of this modulus with pressure; the density of the liquid and the vapor phase; and liquid-vapor coexistence. As a demonstration, we present results for the application of this theory to the behavior of liquid water in a parallel plate capacitor. In particular, we make predictions for the dielectric response of water in the nonlinear regime, finding excellent agreement with known data.},

@article{Martonak2006,
abstract = {Silica is the main component of the Earth's crust and is also of great relevance in many branches of materials science and technology. Its phase diagram is rather intricate and exhibits many different crystalline phases. The reported propensity to amorphization and the strong influence on the outcome of the initial structure and of the pressurization protocol indicate the presence of metastability and large kinetic barriers. As a consequence, theory is also faced with great difficulties and our understanding of the complex transformation mechanisms is still very sketchy despite a large number of simulations. Here, we introduce a substantial improvement of the metadynamics method, which finally brings simulations in close agreement with experiments. We unveil the subtle and non-intuitive stepwise mechanism of the pressure-induced transformation of fourfold-coordinated alpha-quartz into sixfold-coordinated stishovite at room temperature. We also predict that on compression fourfold-coordinated coesite will transform into the post-stishovite alpha-PbO2-type phase. The new method is far more efficient than previous methods, and for the first time the study of complex structural phase transitions with many intermediates is within the reach of molecular dynamics simulations. This insight will help in designing new experimental protocols capable of steering the system towards the desired transition.},

abstract = {The influence of nuclear rotation on weak electron binding in the long range field of a linear polar molecule is treated in a way that leads ultimately, with suitable approximation, to the familiar equations for close coupling of electron-nuclear-rotational motions. Subsequently, a conventional pseudopotential approximation is invoked to examine the rotational spectra of HCN and DCN anions. It is shown that the number of rotationally excited anion states cannot be reliably predicted by assuming that zero binding occurs when the rotational energy equals the electron affinity obtained in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. A method is suggested for combining accurate molecular orbital and parameterized pseudopotential methods to provide accurate electron affinities for very weakly bound anionic states.},

abstract = {Despite the intense interest in metallic glasses for a variety of engineering applications, many details of their structure remain a mystery. Here, we present the first compelling atomic structural model for metallic glasses. This structural model is based on a new sphere-packing scheme-the dense packing of atomic clusters. Random positioning of solvent atoms and medium-range atomic order of solute atoms are combined to reproduce diffraction data successfully over radial distances up to approximately 1 nm. Although metallic glasses can have any number of chemically distinct solute species, this model shows that they contain no more than three topologically distinct solutes and that these solutes have specific and predictable sizes relative to the solvent atoms. Finally, this model includes defects that provide richness to the structural description of metallic glasses. The model accurately predicts the number of solute atoms in the first coordination shell of a typical solvent atom, and provides a remarkable ability to predict metallic-glass compositions accurately for a wide range of simple and complex alloys.},

abstract = {Due to efficient scaling with electron number N, density functional theory (DFT) is widely used for studies of large molecules and solids. Restriction of an exact mean-field theory to local potential functions has recently been questioned. This review summarizes motivation for extending current DFT to include nonlocal one-electron potentials, and proposes methodology for implementation of the theory. The theoretical model, orbital functional theory (OFT), is shown to be exact in principle for the general N-electron problem. In practice it must depend on a parametrized correlation energy functional. Functionals are proposed suitable for short-range Coulomb-cusp correlation and for long-range polarization response correlation. A linearized variational cellular method (LVCM) is proposed as a common formalism for molecules and solids. Implementation of nonlocal potentials is reduced to independent calculations for each inequivalent atomic cell.},

abstract = {We present a generalized definition of subspace occupancy matrices in ab initio methods for strongly correlated materials, such as DFT+U and DFT+DMFT, which is appropriate to the case of nonorthogonal projector functions. By enforcing the tensorial consistency of all matrix operations, we are led to a subspace projection operator for which the occupancy matrix is tensorial and accumulates only contributions which are local to the correlated subspace at hand. For DFT+U in particular, the resulting contributions to the potential and ionic forces are automatically Hermitian, without resort to symmetrization, and localized to their corresponding correlated subspace. The tensorial invariance of the occupancies, energies and ionic forces is preserved. We illustrate the effect of this formalism in a DFT+U study using self-consistently determined projectors.},

abstract = {'Smaller is stronger' does not hold true only for nanocrystalline materials but also for single crystals. It is argued that this effect is caused by geometrical constraints on the nucleation and motion of dislocations in submicrometre-sized crystals. Here, we report the first in situ transmission electron microscopy tensile tests of a submicrometre aluminium single crystal that are capable of providing direct insight into source-controlled dislocation plasticity in a submicrometre crystal. Single-ended sources emit dislocations that escape the crystal before being able to multiply. As dislocation nucleation and loss rates are counterbalanced at about 0.2 events per second, the dislocation density remains statistically constant throughout the deformation at strain rates of about 10(-4) s(-1). However, a sudden increase in strain rate to 10(-3) s(-1) causes a noticeable surge in dislocation density as the nucleation rate outweighs the loss rate. This observation indicates that the deformation of submicrometre crystals is strain-rate sensitive.},

abstract = {The indentation load-displacement behavior of six materials tested with a Berkovich indenter has been carefully documented to establish an improved method for determining hardness and elastic modulus from indentation load-displacement data. The materials included fused silica, soda–lime glass, and single crystals of aluminum, tungsten, quartz, and sapphire. It is shown that the load–displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method. The results show that with good technique, moduli can be measured to within 5\%.},

abstract = {A projector expansion method is presented for an efficient and accurate implementation of the first-principles electronic structure calculations using pseudopotentials and atomic basis functions. By expressing the rapidly varying local potential in the vicinity of nuclei by a separable projector expansion, the difficulty involved in the grid integration using the regular real-space grid is remarkably reduced without increasing the computational effort. To illustrate the capability, it is shown that the proposed method significantly suppresses not only a spurious oscillation in the energy curve for the atomic displacement involved in a weak interaction such as hydrogen bonding, but also the dependence of optimized structure on relative position to the real-space grid in the geometry optimization within a modest grid fineness.},

abstract = {We present a systematic study for numerical atomic basis orbitals$\backslash$nranging from H to Kr, which could be used in large scale O(N) electronic$\backslash$nstructure calculations based on density-functional theories (DFT).$\backslash$nThe comprehensive investigation of convergence properties with respect$\backslash$nto our primitive basis orbitals provides a practical guideline in$\backslash$nan optimum choice of basis sets for each element, which well balances$\backslash$nthe computational efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, starting from$\backslash$nthe primitive basis orbitals, a simple and practical method for variationally$\backslash$noptimizing basis orbitals is presented based on the force theorem,$\backslash$nwhich enables us to maximize both the computational efficiency and$\backslash$naccuracy. The optimized orbitals well reproduce convergent results$\backslash$ncalculated by a larger number of primitive orbitals. As illustrations$\backslash$nof the orbital optimization, we demonstrate two examples: the geometry$\backslash$noptimization coupled with the orbital optimization of a C-60 molecule$\backslash$nand the preorbital optimization for a specific group such as proteins.$\backslash$nThey clearly show that the optimized orbitals significantly reduce$\backslash$nthe computational efforts, while keeping a high degree of accuracy,$\backslash$nthus indicating that the optimized orbitals are quite suitable for$\backslash$nlarge scale DFT calculations.},

abstract = {Computing phase diagrams of model systems is an essential part of computational condensed matter physics. In this paper, we discuss in detail the interface pinning (IP) method for calculation of the Gibbs free energy difference between a solid and a liquid. This is done in a single equilibrium simulation by applying a harmonic field that biases the system towards two-phase configurations. The Gibbs free energy difference between the phases is determined from the average force that the applied field exerts on the system. As a test system, we study the Lennard-Jones model. It is shown that the coexistence line can be computed efficiently to a high precision when the IP method is combined with the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots. Statistical and systematic errors are investigated. Advantages and drawbacks of the IP method are discussed. The high pressure part of the temperature-density coexistence region is outlined by isomorphs.},

To understand the misfit accommodation at the semi-coherent interface, a 1-dimensional (1D) misfit dislocation model and a 2-dimensional (2D) dislocation network model have been studied. For the latter case, our analysis reveals an interface dislocation structure with a network of three sets of parallel dislocations, each with pure-edge character, giving rise to a pattern of coherent and stacking-fault-like regions at the interface. Structural relaxation at elevated temperatures leads to a further change of the dislocation pattern, which can be understood in terms of a competition between the stacking fault energy and the dislocation interaction energy at the interface. Our results are expected to serve as an input for the subsequent dislocation dynamics models to understand and predict the macroscopic mechanical behavior of Al/$\alpha$-Al2O3 composite heterostructures.},

abstract = {The materials discovery process can be significantly expedited and simplified if we can learn effectively from available knowledge and data. In the present contribution, we show that efficient and accurate prediction of a diverse set of properties of material systems is possible by employing machine (or statistical) learning methods trained on quantum mechanical computations in combination with the notions of chemical similarity. Using a family of one-dimensional chain systems, we present a general formalism that allows us to discover decision rules that establish a mapping between easily accessible attributes of a system and its properties. It is shown that fingerprints based on either chemo-structural (compositional and configurational information) or the electronic charge density distribution can be used to make ultra-fast, yet accurate, property predictions. Harnessing such learning paradigms extends recent efforts to systematically explore and mine vast chemical spaces, and can significantly accelerate the discovery of new application-specific materials.},

abstract = {The anodization of aluminum is an electro-chemical process that changes the surface chemistry of the metal, via oxidation, to produce an anodic oxide layer. During this process a self organized, highly ordered array of cylindrical shaped pores can be produced with controllable pore diameters, periodicity and density distribution. This enables anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) membranes to be used as templates in a variety of nanotechnology applications without the need for expensive lithographical techniques. This review article is an overview of the current state of research on AAO membranes and the various applications of nanotechnology that use them in the manufacture of nano-materials and devices or incorporate them into specific applications such as biological/chemical sensors, nano-electronic devices, filter membranes and medical scaffolds for tissue engineering.},

The resulting dividing surfaces require no a priori information or intuition about reaction mechanisms. To generate optimal dividing surfaces, we apply a cycle of machine-learning and refinement of the surface by molecular dynamics sampling. We demonstrate that the machine-learned surfaces contain the relevant low-energy saddle points. The mechanisms of reactions may be extracted from the machine-learned surfaces in order to identify unexpected chemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we show that the machine-learned surfaces significantly increase the transmission coefficient for an adatom exchange involving many coupled degrees of freedom on a (100) surface when compared to a distance-based dividing surface.},

abstract = {There has been relatively little study on time-dependent mechanical properties of nanowires, in spite of their importance for the design, fabrication and operation of nanoscale devices. Here we report a dislocation-mediated, time-dependent and fully reversible plastic behaviour in penta-twinned silver nanowires. In situ tensile experiments inside scanning and transmission electron microscopes show that penta-twinned silver nanowires undergo stress relaxation on loading and complete plastic strain recovery on unloading, while the same experiments on single-crystalline silver nanowires do not exhibit such a behaviour. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the observed behaviour in penta-twinned nanowires originates from the surface nucleation, propagation and retraction of partial dislocations. More specifically, vacancies reduce dislocation nucleation barrier, facilitating stress relaxation, while the twin boundaries and their intrinsic stress field promote retraction of partial dislocations, resulting in full strain recovery.},

abstract = {Self- and binary Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients were determined by equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with the Green-Kubo method. This study covers self-diffusion coefficients at liquid states for eight pure fluids, i.e. F\$\_2\$, N\$\_2\$, CO\$\_2\$, CS\$\_2\$, C\$\_2\$H\$\_6\$, C\$\_2\$H\$\_4\$, C\$\_2\$H\$\_2\$ and SF\$\_6\$ as well as Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients for three binary mixtures N\$\_2\$+CO\$\_2\$, N\$\_2\$+C\$\_2\$H\$\_6\$ and CO\$\_2\$+C\$\_2\$H\$\_6\$. The fluids were modeled by the two-center Lennard-Jones plus point-quadrupole pair potential, with parameters taken from previous work of our group which were determined solely on the basis of vapor-liquid equilibrium data. Self-diffusion coefficients are predicted with a statistical uncertainty less than 1\% and they agree within 2\% to 28\% with the experimental data. The correction of the simulation data due to the finite size of the system increases the value of the self-diffusion coefficient typically by 10\%. If this correction is considered, better agreement with the experimental data can be expected for most of the studied fluids. Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients for three binary mixtures were also predicted, their statistical uncertainty is about 10\%. These results were used to test three empirical equations to estimate Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures, i.e. the equations of Caldwell and Babb, of Darken, and of Vignes. The equations of Caldwell and Babb and of Vignes show qualitatively different behavior of the Maxwell-Stefan diffusion coefficient than that observed in the simulations. In agreement with previous work, the best results are obtained in all cases with the equation of Darken.},

@article{Reuter2004,
abstract = {Previous and present "academic" research aiming at atomic scale understanding is mainly concerned with the study of individual molecular processes possibly underlying materials science applications. Appealing properties of an individual process are then frequently discussed in terms of their direct importance for the envisioned material function, or reciprocally, the function of materials is somehow believed to be understandable by essentially one prominent elementary process only. What is often overlooked in this approach is that in macroscopic systems of technological relevance typically a large number of distinct atomic scale processes take place. Which of them are decisive for observable system properties and functions is then not only determined by the detailed individual properties of each process alone, but in many, if not most cases also the interplay of all processes, i.e. how they act together, plays a crucial role. For a "predictive materials science modeling with microscopic understanding", a description that treats the statistical interplay of a large number of microscopically well-described elementary processes must therefore be applied. Modern electronic structure theory methods such as DFT have become a standard tool for the accurate description of individual molecular processes. Here, we discuss the present status of emerging methodologies which attempt to achieve a (hopefully seamless) match of DFT with concepts from statistical mechanics or thermodynamics, in order to also address the interplay of the various molecular processes. The new quality of, and the novel insights that can be gained by, such techniques is illustrated by how they allow the description of crystal surfaces in contact with realistic gas-phase environments.},

abstract = {The adsorption of Na+ and Cl- at the charged water-platinum interface as a function of external voltage is investigated by molecular dynamics computer simulation. Generally, although the water structure is significantly affected by a strong external electric field, the structure of the ion-water complex at the surface is much less affected. At electric field values comparable to those found in experimental systems, Cl- is ''contact adsorbed'' on the metal and is mainly solvated by the water layer adjacent to the metal. In contrast, the small Na+ is solvated equally well by both adsorbed water molecules and water molecules outside the inner layer. At higher electric field values that are close to the upper end of what is believed to exist in electric double layers, both ions lose part of their hydration shell. The dynamic of the ion motion towards the metal up to about one solvent layer from the surface is in reasonable agreement with experimentally known ion conductivities at low electric fields, but it overestimates the ionic mobility at a high electric field. This can be rationalized in terms of the effect of the electric field on the hydration shell residence time. The final step toward contact adsorption at the very high electric field is instantaneous for Na+, but involves a barrier for Cl-.},

abstract = {Density functional theory (DFT) by itself is insufficient to model electrochemical reactions, because the interface is too large, and there is no satisfactory way to incorporate the electrode potential. In our group we have developed a theory of electrocatalysis, which combines DFT with our model for electrochemical electron transfer, and thereby avoids these difficulties. Our theory explains how a metal d band situated near the Fermi level can lower the energy of activation for a charge transfer reaction. An explicit application to the hydrogen evolution reaction gives results that agree very well with experimental data obtained both on plain and on nanostructured electrodes. Finally, we outline how our method can be extended to other reactions and present first results for the adsorption of OH on Pt(111).},

abstract = {Oxidation can drastically change mechanical properties of nanostructures that typically have large surface-to-volume ratios. However, the underlying mechanisms describing the effect oxidation has on the mechanical properties of nanostructures have yet to be characterized. Here we use reactive molecular dynamics and show that the oxidation enhances the aluminium nanowire ductility, and the oxide shell exhibits superplastic behaviour. The oxide shell decreases the aluminium dislocation nucleation stress by increasing the activation volume and the number of nucleation sites. Superplasticity of the amorphous oxide shell is due to viscous flow as a result of healing of the broken aluminium-oxygen bonds by oxygen diffusion, below a critical strain rate. The interplay between the strain rate and oxidation rate is not only essential for designing nanodevices in ambient environments, but also controls interface properties in large-scale deformation processes.},

The zirconia-coated magnetic CI particles were prepared via sol-gel synthesis in kilogram quantities. The coating layer was approximately 50-100 nm thick, faceted in surface structure, and well adhered. Coated particles showed long-term stability against aqueous corrosion. "Free" nanocrystalline zirconia polishing abrasives were cogenerated in the coating process, resulting in an abrasive-charged powder for MRF. A viable MR fluid was prepared simply by adding water. Spot polishing tests were performed on a variety of optical glasses and ceramics over a period of nearly three weeks with no signs of MR fluid degradation or corrosion. Stable material removal rates and smooth surfaces inside spots were obtained.},

abstract = {To study the variation of the mechanical behavior of binary aluminum copper alloys with respect to their microstructure, a numerical simulation of their granular structure was carried out. The microstructures are created by a repeated inclusion of some predefined basic grain shapes into a representative volume element until reaching a given volume percentage of the $\alpha$-phase. Depending on the grain orientations, the coalescence of the grains can be performed. Different granular microstructures are created by using different basic grain shapes. Selecting a suitable set of basic grain shapes, the modeled microstructure exhibits a realistic aluminum alloy microstructure which can be adapted to a particular cooling condition. Our granular models are automatically converted to a finite element model. The effect of grain shapes and sizes on the variation of elastic modulus and plasticity of such a heterogeneous domain was investigated. Our results show that for a given $\alpha$-phase fraction having different grain shapes and sizes, the elastic moduli and yield stresses are almost the same but the ultimate stress and elongation are more affected. Besides, we realized that the distribution of the $\theta$ phases inside the $\alpha$ phases is more important than the grain shape itself.},

abstract = {Unlike the well-defined long-range order that characterizes crystalline metals, the atomic arrangements in amorphous alloys remain mysterious at present. Despite intense research activity on metallic glasses and relentless pursuit of their structural description, the details of how the atoms are packed in amorphous metals are generally far less understood than for the case of network-forming glasses. Here we use a combination of state-of-the-art experimental and computational techniques to resolve the atomic-level structure of amorphous alloys. By analysing a range of model binary systems that involve different chemistry and atomic size ratios, we elucidate the different types of short-range order as well as the nature of the medium-range order. Our findings provide a reality check for the atomic structural models proposed over the years, and have implications for understanding the nature, forming ability and properties of metallic glasses.},

We report the application of this approach to different transition-metal systems: molecular complexes, ruthenium-dye molecules, ruthenium complexes with noninnocent ligands, and bulk semiconductors. The computations were carried out using density-functional theory with a Hubbard U correction. The oxidation states were determined without ambiguity.},

abstract = {Nanowires have been taken much attention as a nanoscale building block, which can perform the excellent mechanical function as an electromechanical device. Here, we have performed atomic force microscope (AFM)-based nanoindentation experiments of silicon nanowires in order to investigate the mechanical properties of silicon nanowires. It is shown that stiffness of nanowires is well described by Hertz theory and that elastic modulus of silicon nanowires with various diameters from \~{}100 to \~{}600 nm is close to that of bulk silicon. This implies that the elastic modulus of silicon nanowires is independent of their diameters if the diameter is larger than 100 nm. This supports that finite size effect (due to surface effect) does not play a role on elastic behavior of silicon nanowires with diameter of >100 nm.},

@article{Soler2002,
abstract = {We have developed and implemented a selfconsistent density functional method using standard norm-conserving pseudopotentials and a flexible, numerical linear combination of atomic orbitals basis set, which includes multiple-zeta and polarization orbitals. Exchange and correlation are treated with the local spin density or generalized gradient approximations. The basis functions and the electron density are projected on a real-space grid, in order to calculate the Hartree and exchange–correlation potentials and matrix elements, with a number of operations that scales linearly with the size of the system. We use a modified energy functional, whose minimization produces orthogonal wavefunctions and the same energy and density as the Kohn–Sham energy functional, without the need for an explicit orthogonalization. Additionally, using localized Wannier-like electron wavefunctions allows the computation time and memory required to minimize the energy to also scale linearly with the size of the system. Forces and stresses are also calculated efficiently and accurately, thus allowing structural relaxation and molecular dynamics simulations.},

This study has shown that antiperspirants cause DNA damage on a single-cell level. Additionally, our data showed us that in general, Secret Platinum for women and Old Spice for men, produced equivalent damage. Crystal Natural, marketed as being safer or less damaging, induced the most extensive damage of all three antiperspirants tested.},

abstract = {Classical density-functional theory provides an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics simulations for understanding the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous fluids. However, application of density-functional theory to multi-site molecular fluids has so far been limited by complications due to the implicit molecular geometry constraints on the site densities, whose resolution typically requires expensive Monte Carlo methods. Here, we present a general scheme of circumventing this so-called inversion problem: compressed representations of the orientation density. This approach allows us to combine the superior iterative convergence properties of multipole representations of the fluid configuration with the improved accuracy of site-density functionals. Armed with the above general framework, we construct a simplified free-energy functional for water which captures the radial distributions, cavitation energies, and the linear and nonlinear dielectric response of liquid water. The resulting approach will enable efficient and reliable first-principles studies of atomic-scale processes in contact with solution or other liquid environments. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Atomistic simulation is a powerful tool for probing the structure and properties ofmaterials and the nature of chemical reactions. Corrosion is a complex process that involves chemical reactions occurring at the interface between a material and its environment and is, therefore, highly suited to study by atomistic modeling techniques. In this paper, the complex nature of corrosion processes and mechanisms is briefly reviewed. Various atomistic methods for exploring corrosion mechanisms are then described, and recent applications in the literature surveyed. Several instances of the application of atomistic modeling to corrosion science are then reviewed in detail, including studies of the metal-water interface, the reaction of water on electrified metallic interfaces, the dissolution of metal atoms from metallic surfaces, and the role of competitive adsorption in controlling the chemical nature and structure of a metallic surface. Some perspectives are then given concerning the future of atomistic modeling in the field of corrosion science.},

abstract = {It is shown using quantum theory that the ?0.9 V experimentally observed onset potential for O2 reduction to water over platinum electrodes, which is much less than the standard reversible potential, 1.229 V, is caused by the ?1.2 eV exergonicity of the OOH(ads) dissociation step. The reduction in Gibbs energy available for electrical work leads to an effective reversible potential of about 0.93 V. These findings come from a fully self-consistent density functional treatment that includes surface charging for changing the electrode potential, and double-layer relaxation in response. It is shown that the adsorption Gibbs energies for reaction intermediates on an ideal catalyst can be predicted from solution phase reversible potentials. For O2 reduction, the ideal catalyst will have OOH(aq), O(aq), and OH(aq) adsorption energies of, respectively, 1.35, 2.41, and 1.49 eV at 1.229 V electrode potential.

abstract = {A method is proposed for carrying out molecular dynamics simulations of processes that involve electronic transitions. The time dependent electronic Schrodinger equation is solved self-consistently with the classical mechanical equations of motion of the atoms. At each integration time step a decision is made whether to switch electronic states, according to probabilistic "fewest switches" algorithm. If a switch occurs, the component of velocity in the direction of the nonadiabatic coupling vector is adjusted to conserve energy. The procedure allows electronic transitions to occur anywhere among any number of coupled states, governed by the quantum mechanical probabilities. The method is tested against accurate quantal calculations for three one-dimensional, two-state models, two of which have been specifically designed to challenge any such mixed classical-quantal dynamical theory. Although there are some discrepancies, initial indications are encouraging. The model should be applicable to a wide variety of gas-phase and condensed-phase phenomena occurring even down to thermal energies.},

For Brownian motion without solute–solute interactions, we recover the characteristic features of an infinitely dilute solution. For interacting brownons, the results exhibit a noticeable dependence of the calculated self‐diffusion coefficients on the influence of the Coulomb forces. The model system exhibits ion association when the Coulomb forces are made strong enough.},

Here we report measurements of plastic yielding for single crystals of micrometer-sized dimensions for three different types of metals. We find that within the tests, the overall sample dimensions artificially limit the length scales available for plastic processes. The results show dramatic size effects at surprisingly large sample dimensions. These results emphasize that at the micrometer scale, one must define both the external geometry and internal structure to characterize the strength of a material.},

In this review, we summarize the basic principles that define the diabatic basis and demonstrate how they can be applied in the specific context of constrained density functional theory. Using illustrative examples from electron transfer and chemical reactions, we show how the diabatic picture can be used to extract qualitative insight and quantitative predictions about energy landscapes. The review closes with a brief summary of the challenges and prospects for the further application of diabatic states in chemistry.},

abstract = {We have developed a first-principles-based hierarchical simulation framework, which seamlessly integrates (1) a quantum mechanical description based on the density functional theory (DFT), (2) multilevel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a reactive force field (ReaxFF) that describes chemical reactions and polarization, a nonreactive force field that employs dynamic atomic charges, and an effective force field (EFF), and (3) an atomistically informed continuum model to reach macroscopic length scales. For scalable hierarchical simulations, we have developed parallel linear-scaling algorithms for (1) DFT calculation based on a divide-and-conquer algorithm on adaptive multigrids, (2) chemically reactive MD based on a fast ReaxFF (F-ReaxFF) algorithm, and (3) EFF-MD based on a space-time multiresolution MD (MRMD) algorithm. On 1920 Intel Itanium2 processors, we have demonstrated 1.4 million atom (0.12 trillion grid points) DFT, 0.56 billion atom F-ReaxFF, and 18.9 billion atom MRMD calculations, with parallel efficiency as high as 0.953. Through the use of these algorithms, multimillion atom MD simulations have been performed to study the oxidation of an aluminum nanoparticle. Structural and dynamic correlations in the oxide region are calculated as well as the evolution of charges, surface oxide thickness, diffusivities of atoms, and local stresses. In the microcanonical ensemble, the oxidizing reaction becomes explosive in both molecular and atomic oxygen environments, due to the enormous energy release associated with Al-O bonding. In the canonical ensemble, an amorphous oxide layer of a thickness of approximately 40 angstroms is formed after 466 ps, in good agreement with experiments. Simulations have been performed to study nanoindentation on crystalline, amorphous, and nanocrystalline silicon nitride and silicon carbide. Simulation on nanocrystalline silicon carbide reveals unusual deformation mechanisms in brittle nanophase materials, due to coexistence of brittle grains and soft amorphous-like grain boundary phases. Simulations predict a crossover from intergranular continuous deformation to intragrain discrete deformation at a critical indentation depth.},

abstract = {The energy of a large number of oxidation reactions of 3d transition$\backslash$nmetal oxides is computed using the generalized gradient approach$\backslash$n(GGA) and GGA+U methods. Two substantial contributions to the error$\backslash$nin GGA oxidation energies are identified. The first contribution$\backslash$noriginates from the overbinding of GGA in the O2 molecule and only$\backslash$noccurs when the oxidant is O2. The second error occurs in all oxidation$\backslash$nreactions and is related to the correlation error in 3d orbitals$\backslash$nin GGA. Strong self-interaction in GGA systematically penalizes a$\backslash$nreduced state (with more d electrons) over an oxidized state, resulting$\backslash$nin an overestimation of oxidation energies. The constant error in$\backslash$nthe oxidation energy from the O2 binding error can be corrected by$\backslash$nfitting the formation enthalpy of simple nontransition metal oxides.$\backslash$nRemoval of the O2 binding error makes it possible to address the$\backslash$ncorrelation effects in 3d transition metal oxides with the GGA+U$\backslash$nmethod. Calculated oxidation energies agree well with experimental$\backslash$ndata for reasonable and consistent values of U.},

abstract = {Due to their small footprint and flexible siting, rechargeable batteries are attractive for energy storage systems. A super-valent battery based on aluminium ion intercalation and deintercalation is proposed in this work with VO2 as cathode and high-purity Al foil as anode. First-principles calculations are also employed to theoretically investigate the crystal structure change and the insertion-extraction mechanism of Al ions in the super-valent battery. Long cycle life, low cost and good capacity are achieved in this battery system. At the current density of 50 mAg(-1), the discharge capacity remains 116 mAhg(-1) after 100 cycles. Comparing to monovalent Li-ion battery, the super-valent battery has the potential to deliver more charges and gain higher specific capacity.},

abstract = {Crack-tip behaviour in metals is among the most basic problems in mechanics of materials. Yet, long-standing experimental evidence suggests that crack-tip twinning in face-centred-cubic (f.c.c.) metals is highly dependent on the material, temperature and loading rate, and previous simulations and models predict twinning in aluminium, where it has never been observed. Here, this discrepancy between theory and experiment is resolved through a new model guided and validated by extensive multiscale simulations. Both the analytic model and simulations reveal a transition from crack-tip twinning at short times to full dislocation formation at long times. Applied to a host of f.c.c. metals, the model agrees with experimental trends as it predicts large differences in the thermal activation needed for full dislocation emission to dominate. More broadly, this work demonstrates the necessity of multiscale modelling and attention to rate dependence for accurate description of material behaviour and computationally guided material design.},

abstract = {Nanowires have attracted considerable interest as nanoscale interconnects and as the active components of both electronic and electromechanical devices. Nanomechanical measurements are a challenge, but remain key to the development and processing of novel nanowire-based devices. Here, we report a general method to measure the spectrum of nanowire mechanical properties based on nanowire bending under the lateral load from an atomic force microscope tip. We find that for Au nanowires, Young's modulus is essentially independent of diameter, whereas the yield strength is largest for the smallest diameter wires, with strengths up to 100 times that of bulk materials, and substantially larger than that reported for bulk nanocrystalline metals (BNMs). In contrast to BNMs, nanowire plasticity is characterized by strain-hardening, demonstrating that dislocation motion and pile-up is still operative down to diameters of 40 nm. Possible origins for the different mechanical properties of nanowires and BNMs are discussed.},

abstract = {This fourth edition of the well-established Fundamentals of Semiconductors serves to fill the gap between a general solid-state physics textbook and research articles by providing detailed explanations of the electronic, vibrational, transport, and optical properties of semiconductors. The approach is physical and intuitive rather than formal and pedantic. Theories are presented to explain experimental results. This textbook has been written with both students and researchers in mind. Its emphasis is on understanding the physical properties of Si and similar tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors. The explanations are based on physical insights. Each chapter is enriched by an extensive collection of tables of material parameters, figures, and problems. Many of these problems "lead the student by the hand" to arrive at the results.The major changes made in the fourth edition include: an extensive appendix about the important and by now well-established deep center known as the DX center, additional problems and the solutions to over fifty of the problems at the end of the various chapters.Some of the solutions contain extensions via discussion about topics of current interest in the field of semiconductor physics, such as spin-orbit coupling and k-linear band dispersion.},

abstract = {The main aim of this presentation is to give an introduction into$\backslash$nspin-polarized density- functional-theory (DFT) calculations as a$\backslash$nmethod to predict and understand the band magnetism of itinerant$\backslash$nelectrons at zero temperature. It will be pointed out that, for instance$\backslash$nthe ferromagnetism of Fe, Co, and Ni is correctly predicted by such$\backslash$ncalculations without adjustable parameters and that the results can$\backslash$nbe explained in terms of a simple Stoner model. For practical applications$\backslash$nit will be discussed why the convergence of density-functional self-consistency$\backslash$niterations can be very slow for magnetic systems and how this problem$\backslash$ncan be alleviated. As illustrating examples of recent applications$\backslash$nin computational nanoscience, results for magnetic monatomic rows$\backslash$non noble metal substrates will be presented. Finally it will be argued$\backslash$nthat the magnetism in certain materials, for instance in antiferromagnets,$\backslash$ndoes not arise from rigid-band shifts as in the Stoner model, but$\backslash$nfrom covalent interactions between the electronic states of the participating$\backslash$natoms.},

abstract = {Using a reactive force field (ReaxFF), we investigated the structural, energetic, and adhesion properties, of both solid and liquid Al/alpha-Al2O3 interfaces. The ReaxFF was developed solely with ab initio calculations on various phases of Al and Al2O3 and Al-O-H clusters. Our computed lattice constants, elastic constants, surface energies, and calculated work of separation for the solid-solid interface agree well with earlier first-principles calculations and experiments. For the liquid-solid system, we also investigated the nonwetting-wetting transition of liquid Al on alpha-Al2O3(0001). Our results revealed that the evaporation of Al atoms and diffusion of O atoms in alpha-Al2O3 lead to the wetting of liquid Al on the oxide surface. The driving force for this process is a decrease in interfacial energy. The nonwetting-wetting transition was found to lie in the 1000-1100 K range, which is in good agreement with sessile drop experiments.},

abstract = {Although deformation processes in submicron-sized metallic crystals are well documented, the direct observation of deformation mechanisms in crystals with dimensions below the sub-10-nm range is currently lacking. Here, through in situ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) observations, we show that (1) in sharp contrast to what happens in bulk materials, in which plasticity is mediated by dislocation emission from Frank-Read sources and multiplication, partial dislocations emitted from free surfaces dominate the deformation of gold (Au) nanocrystals; (2) the crystallographic orientation (Schmid factor) is not the only factor in determining the deformation mechanism of nanometre-sized Au; and (3) the Au nanocrystal exhibits a phase transformation from a face-centered cubic to a body-centered tetragonal structure after failure. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for the vast amount of theoretical modelling on the deformation mechanisms of nanomaterials that have appeared in recent years.},

@article{Stukowski2010b,
abstract = {We describe a novel method for extracting dislocation lines from atomistic simulation data in a fully automated way. The dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA) generates a geometric description of dislocation lines contained in an arbitrary crystalline model structure. Burgers vectors are determined reliably, and the extracted dislocation network fulfills the Burgers vector conservation rule at each node. All remaining crystal defects (grain boundaries, surfaces, etc), which cannot be represented by one-dimensional dislocation lines, are output as triangulated surfaces. This geometric representation is ideal for visualization of complex defect structures, even if they are not related to dislocation activity. In contrast to the recently proposed on-the-fly dislocation detection algorithm (ODDA) Stukowski ( 2010 Modelling Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. [/0965-0393/18/1/015012] 18 015012 ) the new method is extremely robust. While the ODDA was designed for a computationally efficient on-the-fly analysis, the DXA method enables a detailed analysis of dislocation lines even in highly distorted crystal regions, as they occur, for instance, close to grain boundaries or in dense dislocation networks.},
